ofxRenderer
===========

A ragbag of (mostly) GLSL shaders.

Introduction
------------
This repo started as a good idea for wrapping shaders and other
arbitrary drawing code, but it's turned into something that
shouldn't be built on. There's some useful code in here though,
including a basic fluid sim, optical flow and some util shaders.

Dev'ed under MacOS hence the old version of GLSL.
